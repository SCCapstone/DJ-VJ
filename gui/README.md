## DJ-VJ Sample GUI
DJ-VJ is an easy to use video jockey software that listens to to nearby audio input then displays video clips based on the sound it hears.
Ultimately, there are two types of end users for the program. VJs who are creating shows (creators), and users who are displaying these shows at their musical performances (displayers).

This project is the beginning of a Python GUI program that can be used by both types of users, both creators and displayers. To show the GUI, you must have Python3 installed. Then, clone the repo, and run the program from the command line using the command
`python3 djvj-GUI.py`. 

Upon running the program, you'll first see the DJ-VJ loading screen. Then, the main screen of the program will load. There, users will see 3 options. 
The first, "Create Show", will be for creators to create their show. 
The second option, "Load Show", will be for displayers to choose the show that goes with their performance.
The third, "Default Show", will let displayers play music while default clips will play based on default parameters.

Check back later to see more development on this project!
