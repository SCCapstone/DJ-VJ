*Image effects 
	the code Smoothing.cpp will show different effects that can be added to a photo or video using opencv.
	as the code is already built, you can go under the build folder and write "./Smoothing" in the terminal to see

2) install opencv

Instruction for image effects
1) `mkdir build`, **only do once**.
2) `cd build; cmake ..` to create the Makefile, **only do once**
3) `make` to build the examples. **Do each time you change your source code, and want to build and execute the program** 
4)execute an example, e.g. `./Smoothing`
